Access modifiers/specifiers:
public	-The code is accessible for all classes	
private	-The code is only accessible within the declared class	
protected	-The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter
default	-The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	



Oops concept in Java:

1.Class - Class is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behaviors and common properties/ attributes
   i.attributes - variables - to store a data
   ii.behaviors - functions/methods - A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller.

2.Object - object Object is a instance of class and is used to call methods and object name is should be same as class name

3.Encapsulation-  hiding the personal data using private (variable)

4.Inheritance -  base class is inherited to the derived class.
   i.Single level Inhertiance    - 
  ii.Multilevel Inheritance
 iii.Multiple Inheritance - interface -
  iv.Hierarical Inheritane
   v.Hybrid Inheritance

5.Polymorphism-  methods overloading - complie time(same method name,different argument,in a single class) - , 
                 method overriding - runtime(same method name, same argument,in different class) 

6.Abstracton- process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
              Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces
              abstrart class /abtsract methods (i.if we are using abstract method in abstract class we must use abstract keyword, ii.abstract can use normal method, iii.abstract cannot have obj creation but in object way)
