Operators:
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators:
	+,-,*,/,%,
	**	Exponentiation	
	//	Floor division
Assignment operators:
	=	
Comparison operators:
	>,<,<=,>=,==,!= 
Logical operators:
	and,or,not
Identity operators:
	is	-Returns true if both variables are the same object
	is not	-Returns true if both variables are not the same object
Membership operators:
in	- Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in	- Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

Bitwise operators:
	&,|,^,~,<<,>>


Example:
	x = 5
	print(x > 3 and x < 10)
	x = 5
	print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))

Identity Operators:
------------------------
  , x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x
print(x is z)

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x
print(x is not z)

Membership Operator:
-----------------------------
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("banana" in x)


x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("pineapple" not in x)
